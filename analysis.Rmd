```{r, Warning=FALSE}


batting<-read.csv("../EDA_Data/Batting.csv",header=TRUE)
pitching<-read.csv("../EDA_Data/Pitching.csv",header=TRUE)

suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
```

```{r}
batting2 = filter(batting, batting$yearID > 1985) %>% select(yearID,H,X2B,X3B,HR,AB,BB,HBP,SF,) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(TB = H+X2B+(2*X3B)+(3*HR)) %>% mutate(SLG = TB/AB) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(OBP = (H + BB + HBP)/(AB + BB + SF + HBP)) %>% mutate(OPS = SLG + OBP)

table = batting2 %>% group_by(yearID) %>% summarise(avgOPS = mean(OPS))
```

```{r}
ggplot(table, aes(x =yearID, y = avgOPS)) + geom_point()+ geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
pitching2 = filter(pitching, pitching$yearID > 1985) %>% select(yearID,ERA) %>% na.omit
table2 = pitching2 %>% group_by(yearID) %>% summarise(avgERA = mean(ERA))
```

```{r}
ggplot(table2, aes(x =yearID, y = avgERA)) + geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```

WE can see that ERA started to go down when OPS did. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
#str(master_file)
#Things to consider for for RQ's: strikeouts and era for pitchers pre, during and post(steriod use).....also obp and batting average for hitters pre, during and post.
#Steriod use staring around late 80's and dying out in 2003, yet continuing to see suspensions to this day for steriods.
